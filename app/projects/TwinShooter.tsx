        <p>
          This was my first game I ever made on Unity, learning the basics of movement, common coding practices, and game development
          specifics like health, collision detection, and others.

        <p>
          It was my first time ever developing something in Unity without using any tutorials. I was often confused on how to
          approach a certain problem and sometimes I became frustrated that I didn't know more. However, I managed to perservere and
          code a beginner game that I am proud of.
